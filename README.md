# 🐾 PetHousing — Building Real Homes for Stray Pets Through Web3
PetHousing is a community-driven blockchain project dedicated to providing safe shelter, food, and medical support for stray cats and dogs around the world. By combining the power of decentralized finance with transparent on-chain donations, PetHousing transforms digital value into real-world impact.

Every transaction helps support our mission to build sustainable pet housing programs, partner with local rescue organizations, and create long-term solutions for animal welfare. All donation activity is publicly verifiable on-chain, ensuring accountability, transparency, and trust.

PetHousing is not just a token — it is a movement powered by people who believe that technology should be used to create positive change. Together, we are building a future where no pet is left without a home.
